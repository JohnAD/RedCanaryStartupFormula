SCHEDULED EVENTS

These are the planned events for the new company. As always, things are changeable
by agreement of the shareholders, but this sets up the common expectations:


PHASE 0: PRIOR TO STARTUP WEEKEND

Up to 45 hours of planning and $300 of expense by one or up to five individuals in preparation of the weekend.

This planning can consist of minor forms of registration and legal work:

1. Forming a simple corporate 'shell' that has no tangible assets or operations.
2. Starting registration of a trademark that *might* be used.
3. Getting a domain name that *might* be used.
4. Making artwork or logo ideas that *might* be used.
5. Researching, but not signing up for, insurance or accounting services.

... or anything else that is very minor in nature.

Doing any more than this violates the spirit and rules of the Startup Weekend concept and is
inherently unfair to the new company team.

These hours and expense are added to the 'phase 2' accumulation of hours and investment.

Should it turn out that these 45hr / $300 limits are violated, it is expected that the excess
hours and assets are simply 'donated without compensation or expectation of return' to the company.

Not doing that makes you a 'bad person'. I realize the phrase 'bad person' has no legal meaning,
but at least you know now.

PHASE 1-A: STARTUP WEEKEND - THE PITCH

At the startup weekend one individual will go a 30 second pitch on Friday in the hopes that the team forms.

Ideally, at the very end, pitcher will say 'we will follow the RED CANARY plan'. Even if not, a sign saying such will
be placed on the wall next to where the votes happen.

If we win, then this process continues to PHASE 1-B.

If we don't win, then this company WILL NOT be worked on. The one to five will decide later what to do. Ideally,
those one to five will instead work with other team(s) that did win. This RED CANARY plan no longer applies any more.

PHASE 1-B: TEAM BUILDING

After the winners are announced, the teams form for each startup.

The person who did the Pitch is "Benevolent Dictator" of the startup for 60 days. Somebody has to be in charge and it is not realistic to 'vote on things' in a twenty-minute team-building excersize.

A group will form. The Benevolent Dictator will have final say but will acquiese to group opinion as much as possible.

At the very end, everyone will put their names and contact info on a list.

PHASE 1-C: WORK, CREATE, BUILD

Everyone works super hard to start the company all weekend. What that means varies from company to company, but give it
'all you can!'

To set expectations:
    * Everyone is equal. A 'developers' time is not more or less valuable than a 'artists' time. etc.
    * In general, we will not be "counting hours".
      However, if someone signs up for the team and then puts in less than 12 hours, then the BD can forfeit their spot
      on the board of directors. This should be the ONLY way to forfeit a spot.
    * wanting a full nights sleep is okay. Some folks stay up 54 hours in a row. That is not against the rules, but
      please don't expect 'extra credit'




PHASE 1-D: PRESENTATION BATTLE

PHASE 2-A: BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Corporate formation with 5000 shares total. Shares are released using the following formula:

   50 SHARES per PERSON involved in startup weekend (even if pulled from the board)

PHASE 2-B: 60DAYS

For the first 60 days, 'new shares' are released at the following formula:

   1 SHARE for 1 HOUR
   1 SHARE for $30

All time and money done during 'PHASE 0', prior to startup weekend is also released using this formula. Given
the restrictions of phase 1, this is a maximum of 55 SHARES. (45 + $300/$30)

PHASE 3: AT 6 MONTHS

A second calculation of 'new shares' is made using the following formula:

   1 SHARE for 2 HOURS
   1 SHARE for $60

Notice that the calculation is less generous.

The board meets once again and decides who, if anyone, is elible for further 'labor for shares' in PHASE 4.

PHASE 4: AT 12 MONTHS

This should be, ideally, the end of "labor for shares" period. Using the following formula:

   1 SHARE for 3 HOURS
   1 SHARE for $100

The final 6 months of 'sweat equity' shares are completed. Done.

At this point, the 'RED CANARY' scheduling comes to an end. Best of luck.
